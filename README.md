# Project: Dark Version Implementation of Main Page
[link](https://elis1386.github.io/public-responsive-fs16/)
In this project, I implemented a dark version of the main page using the Maido Multipurpose Ghost Blog Theme as a resource.

During the implementation, I utilized semantic tags to structure the content:

<header>: Used for the page header.
<main>: Used as the main content area.
<section>: Utilized to divide the content into sections.
<article>: Employed for individual articles or pieces of content.
<figure>: Used for embedding media content.
<figcaption>: Utilized to provide a caption for the media within the <figure> tag.
<footer>: Used for the page footer.

In addition to semantic tags, I leveraged 
 - Flexbox
 - Flex Grid 
for creating responsive layouts and aligning elements effectively.

For styling the project, I followed these steps:

# Initial Styling: 
I began by applying CSS styles to the project to achieve a basic look and layout.

# Transition to SCSS: 
After the initial styling was complete, I transitioned from CSS to SCSS (Sass) to take advantage of its features like variables and mixins.
